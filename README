This is the README file of python-mcrypt.

Description
-----------

The python mcrypt module provides an interface for the mcrypt library.

Mcrypt is a library which provides a uniform interface to several symmetric
encryption algorithms. It is intended to have a simple interface to access
encryption algorithms in ofb, cbc, cfb, ecb and stream modes. The algorithms it
supports are DES, 3DES, RIJNDAEL, Twofish, IDEA, GOST, CAST-256, ARCFOUR,
SERPENT, SAFER+, and more.

Features
--------

The python-mcrypt module provides the following features:

o  Free software (GNU Lesser General Public License).
o  Support for Python newstyle classes, allowing subclassing.
o  Comprehensive unitttests.
o  Support for many well known and less known algorithms and modes. (*)
o  Support for fixlength algorithm, adjusting encrypted data length
   even for block algorithms and modes.
o  Support for direct file encryption.
o  Complete inline documentation.
o  Check parameters before passing to mcrypt library, protecting
   agains segmentation faults.
